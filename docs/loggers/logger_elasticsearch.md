# Logger: ElasticSearch client

ElasticSearch client to remote ElasticSearch server

Options:

* `server` (string)
  > Elasticsearch server url.
  > Specify the URL of your Elasticsearch server.

* `index` (string)
  > Elasticsearch index.
  > Define the name of the Elasticsearch index to use.

* `bulk-size` (integer)
  > Bulk size to be used for bulk batches in bytes.
  > Set the maximum size of each bulk batch before sending it to Elasticsearch.

* `bulk-channel-size` (integer)
  > Maximum number of bulk messages in buffer.
  > Specifies the maximum number of bulk messages in buffer before to drop it.

* `compression`  (string)
  > Compression for bulk messages: `none`, `gzip`.
  > Specifies the compression algorithm to use.

* `chan-buffer-size` (integer)
  > Specifies the maximum number of packets that can be buffered before discard additional packets.
  > Set to zero to use the default global value.

* `flush-interval` (integer)
  > Interval in seconds before to flush the buffer.
  > Set the maximum time interval before the buffer is flushed. If the bulk batches reach this interval before reaching the maximum size, they will be sent to Elasticsearch.

* `basic-auth-enable` (bool)
  > Enable basic authentication (login+password) to ElasticSearch

* `basic-auth-login` (string)
  > The login username

* `basic-auth-pwd` (string)
  > The password

Defaults:

```yaml
- name: elastic
  elasticsearch:
    server: "http://127.0.0.1:9200/"
    index:  "dnscollector"
    chan-buffer-size: 0
    bulk-size: 1048576 # 1MB
    flush-interval: 10 # in seconds
    compression: none
    bulk-channel-size: 10
    basic-auth-enable: false
    basic-auth-login: ""
    basic-auth-pwd: ""
```

> Could you explain the difference between `bulk-size` and `bulk-channel-size`?

`bulk-size` refers to the size of the batch of DNS messages sent to your Elasticsearch instance.
Since sending these batches can take time, `bulk-channel-size` defines the number of batches
the DNS collector can hold in memory before dropping them.
